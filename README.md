# 🔥 SMB (Server Message Block :port numbers 139 and 445) :
  
### What is SMB?(Like FTP)

SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the servers.

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

### How does SMB work?

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.


### What runs SMB?

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix system

### Enumeration Of SMB :

Typically, there are SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information — you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.

### Port Scanning

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in depth as you like on this, however I suggest using nmap with the -A and -p- tags.

          -A : Enables OS Detection, Version Detection, Script Scanning and Traceroute all in one

          -p- : Enables scanning across all ports, not just the top 1000


### Enum4Linux

Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official github.

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: "enum4linux [options] ip"

            TAG            FUNCTION

            -U             get userlist
            -M             get machine list
            -N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
            -S             get sharelist
            -P             get password policy information
            -G             get group and member list

            -A             all of the above (full basic enumeration)
            
           
### SMBClient -- SMB Exploiting 

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it is available by default on Kali and Parrot, if you do need to install it, you can find the documentation here.

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

      smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]

      Followed by the tags:

      -U [name] : to specify the user

      -p [port] : to specify the port       
            
            
### Example :
             smbclient -L 10.10.10.11
             sbmclient //10.10.10.11/profiles -U username -p portnumber
             
### 🔥 SAMBA :

Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. It allows end users to access and use files, printers and other commonly shared resources on a companies intranet or internet. Its often referred to as a network file system.
Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is developed only for Windows, without Samba, other computer platforms would be isolated from Windows machines, even if they were part of the same network.

### Enumerate Samba :

Using nmap we can enumerate a machine for SMB shares.

Nmap has the ability to run to automate a wide variety of networking tasks. There is a script to enumerate shares!

#### 👀 nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse MACHINE_IP

SMB has two ports, 445 and 139.

On most distributions of Linux smbclient is already installed. Lets inspect one of the shares.

smbclient //<ip>/anonymous

Using your machine, connect to the machines network share.

# Telnet (Basic Port 23) :

### What is Telnet?

Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

### Replacement

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.
 
### How does Telnet work?

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: "telnet [ip] [port]"

### Types of Telnet Exploit

Telnet, being a protocol, is in and of itself insecure for the reasons we talked about earlier. It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control. There are CVE's for Telnet client and server systems, however, so when exploiting you can check for those on:

https://www.cvedetails.com/
https://cve.mitre.org/
A CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they usually mean the CVE ID number assigned to a security flaw.

However, you're far more likely to find a misconfiguration in how telnet has been configured or is operating that will allow you to exploit it.

Method Breakdown

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - There is a poorly hidden telnet service running on this machine

    - The service itself is marked "backdoor"

    - We have possible username of "Skidy" implicated

Using this information, let's try accessing this telnet port, and using that as a foothold to get a full reverse shell on the machine!

Connecting to Telnet

You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax:

    "telnet [ip] [port]"

We're going to need to keep this in mind as we try and exploit this machine.

# 🎆 NFS(Network File System :TCP port 2049 ) :

NFS, or Network File System, was designed in 1984 by Sun Microsystems. This distributed file system protocol allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in the same way they would access a local storage file. Because it is an open standard, anyone can implement the protocol. NFS started in-system as an experiment but the second version was publicly released after the initial success.
### 😬 How does NFS work?
To access data stored on another machine (i.e. a server) the server would implement NFS daemon processes to make data available to clients. The server administrator determines what to make available and ensures it can recognize validated clients.

From the client's side, the machine requests access to exported data, typically by issuing a mount command. If successful, the client machine can then view and interact with the file systems within the decided parameters.

### 👽Mount :
Mounting a filesystem simply means making the particular filesystem accessible at a certain point in the Linux directory tree. When mounting a filesystem it does not matter if the filesystem is a hard disk partition, CD-ROM, floppy, or USB storage device. You simply need to know the device name associated with the particular storage device and a directory you would like to mount it to. 

### Now time to Exploit NFS :

Process :
          Use showmount command for checking mount file on target machine
          
          showmount -e ip
          shouwmount -e 10.10.71.180   (Example )
          
          Result :
          /var/nfs/general * 
          
          

Then , 
      attach mount file  in your local pc using mount command


          sudo mount ip:/mount_file_path  your_local_file_path

          sudo mount 10.10.71.180:/var/nfs/general /mnt     

#### 👀 Note : 
              /var/nfs/general  is mount share file via nfs 
              /mnt is locat dirtectory where mount file will be saved
        
Then ,
      Check mount file on your local device :

                                             ls -la /mnt
                                                                          
                                             total 12
                                             drwxr-xr-x  2 nobody nogroup 4096 Nov 21 10:24 .
                                             drwxr-xr-x 19 root   root    4096 Mar 20 23:41 ..
                                             -rw-r--r--  1 root   root      31 Nov 21 10:24 credentials.bak


Finally  , 
          Read mount file :

                    sudo cat /mnt/credential.bak

                    paradoxial.test
                    ShibaPretzel79

##### 😍Here , paradoxial.test is the username of victim and ShibaPretzel79 is the password of victim

🙄 Happy Hacking 😍

#### Note :UDP port for NFS is 111

When nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This is just a server that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to serve. 

In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

#### 👀 nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount MACHINE_IP
